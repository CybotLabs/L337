## Alexa/Raspberry Pi Tutorial Video
This video is priority one.   @henrymendez put together a bunch of scripts to make this process super simple.  If you don't want to wait until the video comes out you can hop over to his git and follow those instructions. That will get you to where you need to be in no time flat!

## [L3-37 Version 2]

## [2.0.0] - Coming Soon
### Definite Changes from V1
-Removing the Arduino Nano completely.  It's unecessary.  Looking into potentially using pigpio to control the servo. 
-Removing the Buck Converter and changing it to a better regulated power step down. The current buck is too noisy. 

### Possible Changes from V1
-Changing to a less powerful servo with a servo-block (half 3D printed, half aluminum) to make the head more level and save the SBEC Circuit. 
-Want to add a better amplification system.
